A photon  a dcrete particle that has wave charactertics (a finite wave traveling like a bullet).  As the photon travels it collides with electrons in the matter of the medium it  traveling in.  Depending on the energy of the photon and the allowed energy bands of the medium the photon cause the electron to jump up a level.  f the photon  absorbed then the medium will increase its motion (at the macro scale increasing its temperature).  f the photon  not absorbed it will be re-emitted (really as a new photon).  have read and watched Feynman's QED lectures and book and have a pretty good understanding of h process for determining  all these paths come together to give the net path of the photon.  The general rule of thumb  that the photon wants to take the path  requires the least amount of time.   understand  th principle goes to explain refraction and reflection.  \n",

The explanation  that liquid water, as a polar solvent, actually dsolves itself, and hydrogen ions (naked protons) travel relatively freely among atoms of water in its liquid and even gaseous states, forming hydronium where the hydrogen atom  gained, and hydroxide where it's lost.\n",

Now, three electrons don't divide by two; classically, we're taught that the double and single bonds alternate, but really, the behavior of th construct indicates that the last valence electron of each carbon atom  itself shared between its two neighbors, giving each carbon \"one and a half\" bonds with either of its neighbors.

For those who don't know, Bohmian mechanics  an interpretation of quantum mechanics that  in the class of  are known as \"hidden variable theories\",  are theories that posit the probabiltic and unreal wave functions of quantum mechanics are not the whole story of   going on but that there  hidden information behind that scenes and not accessible to our measuring devices  provides a determintic and well-defined physical state to the particle at each point in time, allowing us to speak of events proper, as opposed to just measurements with no idea of   going on in between or even saying it doesn't ext at all or  meaningless despite our intuition not barfing at it in the way it would when presented with a truly meaningless phrase like \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\". t accomplhes th, at least in the context of simple fixed-particle non-relativtic QM with classical forces (\"semiclassical mechanics\"), by positing first a universal wavefunction, like in Everett's many worlds theories, and then on top of that a hidden particle position for each particle in its universe that evolves according to a \"guiding equation\" that results in the particle positions having a Born rule dtribution at every point in time, and  effectively adds a \"tracer\" to the \"many worlds\"   taken as describing the actual world we see and  we don't see the others. (Some people wonder about the fate of the other \"worlds\" in the wave function  then become so-called \"empty waves\", but  won't get into that here. 'm more interested in the pure structure of the theory itself, for the point of th inquiry.) t provides a rather neat account of the quantum measurement problem that both subsumes decoherence and addresses the uniqueness of outcomes: the measurement causes a local collapse through the same Everett-style decoherence process, and then the particles making up both the measured and measurer are shunted down a single branch of the universal wave function, thus explaining  we never see the rest. t has no invocation of nondeterminstic behavior at some kind of unspecifiable and ill-defined when-time (e.g. \"when a measurement\" ... but when  that  in the process does the nondetermintic collapse strike Or \"when in consciousness\" But when then  in the brain does th happen Etc.)  can plague some other interpretations. Or in terms  like, you can write a computer program to play a Universe game with the physics engine running Bohmian mechanics with no ambiguity at all as to where to place things like calls to the random number generator to collapse wavefunctions, something made not at all clear in the Copenhagen Non-nterpretation.\n",

And indeed it makes not an exception to that, and does indeed involve such a communication of the hidden information. And th poses a serious problem for generalization of it to relativtic contexts like fully Relativtic Quantum Field Theories (RQFTs), including the celebrated jewel Quantum ElectroDynamics (QED),  make up the best theories of nature we have that are good to up to 12-15 decimal places in some cases, truly awesome marvels of scientific understanding and human endeavor indeed.\n",

      "['Recently  was asked to explain the difference between reflection and total internal reflection from a purely conceptual standpoint (no math).  \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLet me explain   already know.  Reflection and refraction at the quantum level are the same thing.  Light  a photon.  A photon  a dcrete particle that has wave charactertics (a finite wave traveling like a bullet).  As the photon travels it collides with electrons in the matter of the medium it  traveling in.  Depending on the energy of the photon and the allowed energy bands of the medium the photon cause the electron to jump up a level.  f the photon  absorbed then the medium will increase its motion (at the macro scale increasing its temperature).  f the photon  not absorbed it will be re-emitted (really as a new photon).  have read and watched Feynman\\'s QED lectures and book and have a pretty good understanding of h process for determining  all these paths come together to give the net path of the photon.  The general rule of thumb  that the photon wants to take the path  requires the least amount of time.   understand  th principle goes to explain refraction and reflection.  \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  don\\'t seem to understand   does one material seem to cause a higher percentage of refraction compared to another (metal vs. glass).   about the electron configuration of a the medium changes the net effect of the absorption and re-emsions of the photons  s there a change in the probability of the photon being re-emitted in a reverse direction  s there a farther dtance the photon can travel before being incident onto an electron  Th  the part where my understand breaks down.  \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t you have hit the critical angle in a medium that refracts and the light completely reflects, are the photons moving  the same manner as they would be in a material that always reflects  does th connect to the question in the previous paragraph\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t know  have a bunch of mini  embedded in answering th one larger question.

While the detector can detect particles in a two-dimensional surface, the results of the experiment are that particles appear in only two localized areas directly above the path of the particle stream, or directly below the path of the particle stream - spin up or spin down. The conclusions from these measurements are that the particle, when measured, will always have about the same magnitude.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t does th not follow from classical mechanical theory related to magnetm f you shot a magnet through a similar apparatus,  would expect the magnet to be rotated to align with the magnetic field in some way , at high enough field strengths relative to the mass of the magnet, would cause us to measure basically the same magnitude as if the magnet entered the apparatus pre-aligned with the field.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  my explanation incorrect\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\'m studying coherent states of the harmonic oscillator and  have learned about the so called dplacement operator,   the operator defined as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhose action over the fundamental state   to produce a coherent state .\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNow,   it called dplacement operator n  sense does it dplace the state  \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t am new to quantum mechanics, and  just studied some parts of \"wave mechanics\" version of quantum mechanics.

Now \\'m just confused. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\'ll use momentum , wavenumber , and velocity  interchangeably here (i.e., \\'ll use the convention , ).  begin with the momentum dtribution at the time .

Nothing similar to the evolution .\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDcussion : My point was to pick an initial state (real, no current) and s that there  a great amount of current within a very short time, i.e. it seems to me that the difference between  and  happens just about instantaneously. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tn the state  we have no current of probability, . (The current  given by the density of probability times the Bohmian velocity , where   a quantity central in Bohmian interpretations of QM.) \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBut the zero-current doesn\\'t mean there n\\'t any movement, simply the rate of particles moving to the bright counter-balances the rate of leftward going particles.

Th would be a better one to use if we want to talk about the velocity dtribution and the kinetic energy. And, since there are higher bound state energy states, about the classical limit.) \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC) An additional thought: in the classical limit (large number of nodes within some space ), one should be able to talk about a velocity dtribution near a position . t should be something like  where .  does th dtribution compare to any meaning we can gather from the positionless dtribution  Thinking classically  believe that a factor  times the difference in acceleration between the two systems should explain the difference in evolution.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWould there be any way to obtain a position dependent velocity dtribution, or even a quantity similar to th, that would agree in the classical limit\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTh must be the first question everyone asks when starting to study field theory at finite density and zero temperature. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTo introduce a finite density one adds a Lagrange multiplier  fixes the number of particles in a non-relativtic field theory or the number of particles minus the number of antiparticles in a relativtic field theories. To be concrete, in a non-relativtic field theory one has the Lagrangian density:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand then the same theory at finite density  described by:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhere   the chemical potential and the number of particles  .\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t dturbs me  that one may redefine the field:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twith  the time.

Moreover, the path integral measure  invariant under th trivial field redefinition so that the finite density QFT seems equivalent to the zero density one. (Those who are familiarized with the non-relativtic limit of relativtic equation —such as Klein-Gordon or Dirac— will recognize th term and field redefinition.)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSomething similar happens in the relativtic case. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t am  overlooking \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Note that the theory  at zero temperature so  am in real time formalm and  don\\'t have to impose periodic boundary conditions ( think).  am interested in time evolution, scattering, etc.)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tReply to Ron\\'s answer:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t( here will overlook Thomas\\' comments,  will answer him tomorrow.)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRon makes an interesting point, but  think h answer  not correct. The Hamiltonian density of the theory in the original fields :\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t he correctly pointed out  that the Hamiltonian in the new fields  not just the previous Hamiltonian written in the new fields.

And th makes a lot of sense because the theory with  has to be equivalent to the theory with  because we are just subtracting the rest energy.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOf course, th  true as long as one does not impose periodic boundary conditions. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSuppose  want to describe an arbitrary state of a quantum particle in a box of side .

The particles interact with th field and with each other directly (for example, in collions), producing electromagnetic radiation in a continuous spectrum that  constent with the blackbody spectrum.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTh means that only gases  actually couple to the electromagnetic field are allowed to produce blackbody radiation. Th  fine for almost all normal matter** in the universe, as nearly all matter  either overtly electrically charged, or  a composite particle that has charged constituents, and therefore has a fluctuating charge dtribution. (n the case of a photon gas, the constituents themselves are not charged, but the blackbody radiation and the blackbody spectrum are equivalent, because they essentially are blackbody radiation.) Th  not the case for neutrinos. They are long-lived, pointlike particles with no electrical charge, and as such, they should not be able to interact with the electromagnetic field. So a gas of neutrinos would not produce blackbody radiation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ts th believed to be true The only \"neutrino gas\" in thermal equilibrium that \\'m aware of  the ensemble of relic neutrinos created along with the CMB, and the difficulty of measurement of low-energy neutrinos means that we probably won\\'t be measuring th any time soon.

By analogy, the quantum system remains always in a stationary state.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe hidden assumption here  that stationary states (eigenstates of the Hamiltonian) are in some sense attractors of the system: that a system in some energy-superposition will, over time, relax to a single energy eigenstate. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ts th actually true t seems like maybe it n\\'t, since for example coherent states of the harmonic oscillator are stable ().

The resulting macroscopic description  sometimes called emergent. ever, in general, the emergent properties do not always result from the granularity of description.

But then, as  casually poked around Wikipedia and other sites looking to further my knowledge,  found evidence refuting th clear divion. For instance, the explanation of pH on Wikipedia states that pure liquid water, a substance   a textbook example of covalent atomic bonds, n\\'t actually covalent, but an equal mixture of hydronium (H3O+) and hydroxide (OH-) ions. The explanation  that liquid water, as a polar solvent, actually dsolves itself, and hydrogen ions (naked protons) travel relatively freely among atoms of water in its liquid and even gaseous states, forming hydronium where the hydrogen atom  gained, and hydroxide where it\\'s lost.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnother example; benzene. t\\'s composed of 6 carbons and 6 hydrogens. Carbon wants to get four electrons to fill its outer valence shell. The hydrogen fills one, ostensibly by sharing. t gets the other three by sharing electrons with its two neighbors. Now, three electrons don\\'t divide by two; classically, we\\'re taught that the double and single bonds alternate, but really, the behavior of th construct indicates that the last valence electron of each carbon atom  itself shared between its two neighbors, giving each carbon \"one and a half\" bonds with either of its neighbors. That sounds like \"sharing\", but not in the way normally described.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNow, there are other pretty concrete examples of covalence; diatomic gas molecules like O2 and N2 each have a mostly-full valence shell and just want a couple more valence electrons, and so in their diatomic bonds each atom \"pulls\" the other\\'s valence electrons into its own valence shell without losing its own. But, \"highly covalent\" bonds like th seem to be more an exception to the rule than a rule unto itself.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo, maybe from a deeper level, \\'m asking: where  the \"dividing line\" between bonds called \"ionic\" and bonds called \"covalent\" s there a primary property of the bond or the resulting substance that can be given as evidence to say definitively \"th  a(n) ______ bond Or  there indeed some \"grey area\" where the behavior of electrons between atoms could be described both ways at the same time\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\'m familiar with representations of the Lorentz group, that take the form:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\\\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhere  for  are the generators of rotations in the i-j plane (or in the k ax) and  for  are the generators of boosts in the i direction.

The coherency matrix and Stokes parameters descriptions of partially polarized light are related concepts  are more widely known.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCorrect treatment of partial coherent light  important for an appropriate modeling of optical pattern transfer in computer simulations of proximity and projection lithography as currently used by the semiconductor manufacturing industry.   came to th industry, my previous optics \"training\" was insufficient in th area.  found chapter X \"nterference and diffraction with partially coherent light\" in Principles of Optics by Max Born and Emil Wolf most helpful for filling my gaps in th area. Later,  also \"browsed\" through \"Stattical Optics\" by Joseph W. Goodman,  has a nice paragraph in the introduction explaining  insufficient familiarity with stattical optics  so common:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  Surely the preferred way to solve a problem must be the determintic way, with stattics entering only as a sign of our own weakness or limitations. Partially as a consequence of th viewpoint, the subject of stattical optics  usually left for the more advanced students, particularly those with a mathematical flair.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe interesting thing  that Hermitian matrices and eigenvalue decompositions like the Karhunen-Loève expansion are used quite routinely in th field, and they some feel quite similar to modeling of coherence and decoherence in quantum-mechanics.  know that there are important obvious (physical) difference between the two fields, but my actual question   they have in common.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tQuestion\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSome elementary experiments like the double slit experiment are often used to illustrate the particle wave duality of light. ever, the theory of partially coherent light  completely sufficient to describe and predict the outcome of these experiments. There are no particles at all in the theory of partially coherent light, only waves, stattics and uncertainty. The global phase  an unobservable parameter in both theories, but the amplitude of a wave function  only important for the theory of partial coherent light and  commonly normalized away in quantum-mechanics. Th leads to a crucial difference with respect to the possible transformations treated by the respective theories. But  th really a fundamental difference, or just a difference in the common practices of the respective theories  much of the strange phenomena of quantum-mechanics can be explained by the theory of partial coherent light alone, without any reference to particles or measurement processes\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore information on   would actually like to learn\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOne reason for th question  to find out  much familiarity with partial coherence can be assumed when asking  here. Therefore it explains  th familiarity cannot be taken for granted, and  written in a style to allow quite general answers. ever, it also contains specific , indicated by question marks:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t    the theory of partial coherent light related to quantum-mechanics\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  ... the amplitude of a wave function ... But  th really a fundamental difference, or just a difference in the common practices of the respective theories\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   much of the strange phenomena of quantum-mechanics can be explained by the theory of partial coherent light alone, without any reference to particles or measurement processes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDon\\'t be dtracted by my remark about the double slit experiment. Using it to illustrate the particle wave duality of light seemed kind of cheating to me long before  had to cope with partial coherence.  could effortlessly predict the outcome of all these supposedly counter-intuitive experiments without even being familiar with the formalm of quantum-mechanics. Still, the outcome of these experiments  predicted correctly by quantum-mechanics, and independently by the theory of partial coherent light. So these two theories do share some common parts.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAn interesting aspect of the theory of partial coherent light  that things like the mutual intensity or the Stokes parameters can in principle be observed. A simple analogy to the density matrix in quantum-mechanics  the coherency matrix description of  partial polarization. t can be computed in terms of the Stokes parameters\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand hence can in principle be observed. But can the density matrix in quantum-mechanics in principle be observed Well, the measurement process of the Stokes parameters can be described by the following Hermitian matrices , ,  and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t. Only  commutes with all other Hermitian matrices,  some means that each individual part of the density matrix can be observed in olation, but the entire density matrix itself  not observable. But we don\\'t measure all Stokes parameters simultaneous either, or at least that\\'s not  we mean when we say that the Stokes parameters can be measured in principle. Also note the relation of the fact that  commutes with all other Hermitian matrices and the fact that the amplitude of a wave function  commonly normalized away in quantum-mechanics. But the related question  really a serious question for me, because the Mueller calculus for Stokes parameters allows (slightly unintuitive) transformations  seem to be ruled out for quantum-mechanics.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t it  possible to relate the power  of a laser light with frequency , to the amplitude  of its description as a coherent state  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFor a massive particle in an harmonic potential one has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhere   the oscillation amplitude.

Radio waves in the tens-of-Hertz frequency range have wavelengths in the order of thousands of kms. Now if we assume that such a photon extends in space (in the direction of its propagation) such a huge dtance as its wavelength,  should we think of its behaviour when some event occurs to it, such as absorption or reflection Reasonably, the entire photon will change its state instantaneously even though the \"front end\" and \"back end\" of the photon may be very far apart. s not that also a form of nonlocality\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t reale that th line of reasoning hinges on the idea that a photon can have a (more or less) defined extension in space, something that  am very unsure of.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tUsing electrical potential energy  , a particle further away from nucleus has lower magnitude of energy.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tUsing Coulomb\\'s law, a particle further away from nucleus experiences weaker attraction, hence less energy  needed to maintain orbit around that e-shell compared to a electron shell closer to nucleus, hence the one closer to nucleus supposedly should have higher energy.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t know in reality  does not orbit around a atom, but its position exts as a probability density or radial probability function.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t just happened across th over on Math Overflow. t references the following theorem from linear algebra:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  A vector space has the same dimension as its dual if and only if it  finite dimensional.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t would like to ask a physical question using the infinite square well (SW) in quantum mechanics as motivation.

Suppose you have an encrypted message of a certain length   revealed to you over time, and you are trying to decode it.

So \\'escape energy\\' could only be transferred by a photon of energy equal or greater than that minimum threshold energy (i.e. the wavelength of the light had to be a sufficiently short). Each photon of blue light released an electron. But all red photons were too weak. The result  no matter  much red light was sn on the metal plate, there was no current.\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo   the physical explanation of \"electrons could not absorb more than one photon\"  do we know its exactly one For example,  do we know that changing the frequency doesn\\'t change  much photons will get absorbed by one electron One could argue that all photons have the same energy at ever frequency but when you change the frequency, an electron could simply absorb more photons, thus gaining more energy.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOne of the most important results of Classical Mechanics  Liouville\\'s theorem,  tells us that the flow in phase space  like an incompressible fluid. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tever, in the phase space formulation of Quantum Mechanics, one of the main results due to Moyal  that quantum flows are compressible.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo \\'s the intuitive reason for th difference\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFormulated a bit differently:  exactly  the assumption used in the derivation of Liouville\\'s theorem that  no longer valid in Quantum Mechanics\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t suggest the following thought experiment that describes a machine  makes everybody happy.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSuppose a lottery  conducted.

We would like to measure the speed and position of the butterfly by capturing a photograph of it. We can take a photo with a very fast shutter speed and the resulting sharp photo would give a good measure of the position. But th gives a poor measure of the speed. On the other hand, if we take a photo with a slow shutter speed, the resulting photo with a butterfly trail will give an estimate of the speed, but the position information in th photo will be very coarse. He makes it a point that we cannot measure both the speed and the position accurately at the same time and th illustrates the quantum uncertainty principle. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t understand  he tries to convey.

Th would mean that both camera would start at different times, but their timing midpoints will coincide and th will make sure that the cameras capture the information some \\'at the same instant\\'.

Maybe we should look into irreps of th universal cover thingy... perhaps that will reveal something new about nature!\"\\n    \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t    n other words,  irreps of the universal cover Do we just use them because they happen to describe something we know about, or  there reason to suspect they should hold crucial information about the universe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGranted, th question may be silly and quite likely doesn\\'t really have an answer... but \\'m curious nonetheless to have a nice, convincing way of working with irreps of the universal cover other than \"it works.\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEDT:  suppose  should say at the get-go that th question  definitely verging on being a duplicate of th one.  will just preemptively say that  think that hinges more on one already having the ideas of quantum mechanics in play (in particular the need for projective representations to deal with the fact that states are only unique up to phase) --  am asking a bit more generally, even if one knows nothing about quantum mechanics,  they might be lead to consider the universal cover rather than the group itself.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\'m trying to understand the general way to treat a change of reference frame in quantum mechanics.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAs  understand it, if  introduce the reference frame transform by a unitary transformation on the state vectors \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand  also make the transformation on the o', 'bservables, \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe value of every quantity will be equivalently described in both reference frame \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo the Hamiltonian in the new reference frame should be given by \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMy problem  that in the old reference frame, Schrödinger equation says that the evolution  given by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNow expressed in the  new reference frame, we have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  not the form that  expected, that  \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo   the meaning of th result s the Schrödinger equation modified when making a transformation that depends on time or  the new Hamiltonian really \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ts there a classical analogue for th result\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tn general, in quantum mechanics we can prove probability current or the Schrodinger equation and other quantities are gauge invariant. ever, the Hamiltonian n\\'t gauge invariant.

People sometimes rae the objection to the many-worlds interpretation that it\\'s simply too extravagant to be taken seriously--all those different \"parallel realities,\" infinite in number, just so that we don\\'t have to believe in wave function collapse. That\\'s silly. Before we made an observation, the universe was described by a single wave function,  assigned a particular amplitude to every possible observational outcome; after the observation, the universe  described by a single wave function,  assigns a particular amplitude to every possible observational outcome. Before and after, the wave function of the universe  just a particular point in the space of states describing the universe, and that space of states didn\\'t get any bigger or smaller. No new \"worlds\" have really been created; the wave function still contains the same amount of information (after all, in th interpretation its evolution  reversible). t has simply evolved in such a way that there are now a greater number of dtinct subsets of the wave function describing individual conscious beings such as ourselves. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics may or may not be right; but to object to it on the grounds that \"Gee, that\\'s a lot of worlds,\"  wrong-headed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\'m not really understanding the reason \"t has simply evolved in such a way that there are now a greater number of dtinct subsets of the wave function describing individual conscious beings such as ourselves.\"   it saying Can anyone explain me \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t am not bothered that much by the fact that two observers describe the same phenomenon differently.

The difference in the two chances of winning  known as Bell\\'s nequality, and  used as proof that there\\'s actual quantum weirdness going on.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBut it seems to me that the best classical strategy for the game (as summarized above) n\\'t to always rae one finger, but for Bob to always rae 2 fingers, and for Alice to rae 1 finger when her card  red, and 2 fingers when her card  blue.

Clearly th  not the case. For example, the Pound-Rebka experiment involves inescapably quantum-mechanical phenomena such as the Mossbauer effect, but  really just a test of the equivalence principle.

Same with the Hamiltonian, in  case everything  easy.  Write ,  exts when the Hamiltonian  bounded, and the dynamics always start and stop on a subset of bounded energy so we might as well restrict to that subspace as our abstract Hilbert space .  Then the Heenberg operator satfies\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t so has the following evolution equation ODE in the space of operators on the abstract Hilbert space:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd that\\'s  straightforward and clear  wanted the ODE to be when we wanted to have externally driven operators and Hamiltonians. t\\'s just that if you have to specify the external driving in the Schrödinger picture, it belies the adverted claim that the dynamics happen in the Heenberg picture or that the time evolution equation  in the Heenberg picture.  And if the external driving happens directly in the Heenberg picture, then there n\\'t really a  time evolution equation, they just do the things you said they would by fiat.  Seems like cheating either way.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tf there  no answer, you could answer htorically or soft-question if you can explain  or  th happened and  people say there  dynamical evolution in the Heenberg picture when there are time dependent operators.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAre the different interpretations of Quantum mechanics just different viewpoints of the same physical reality Or can experiments dtinguh them Are they empirically dtinguhable or not\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t have read a paper in  Asher Peres states that quantum mechanics needs no interpretation and we can understand it by a minimum number of necessary postulates.

So \\'ll mention in short   sn:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tt  the same configuration as the double slit experiment but with the addition of a \"quantum eraser\". We have two slits and we may or may not include detectors at the slits. We also have a \"quantum eraser\"; th  a device  can change detector results in such a manner that \"-way\" information can no longer be attained from the detector.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\'d like to verify my understanding of th experiment and its conclusions (that it my question; whether  am understanding it correctly):\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif the information in the detectors  erased after detection by the detector, but before any observation by the experimenter (of either the detector or the screen), then we get an interference pattern, just as if the detectors were not there. Th seem to suggest that whether we get an interference pattern depends on whether the \"-way\" information \"exts\" (at the time of observation by the experimenter). \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif the experimenter observes the detectors after detection but prior to deletion, we don\\'t get an interference pattern (the wave function collapses); yet detection by the detectors, in itself, does not collapse the wave function (because as mentioned, we can still delete the information and get an interference pattern). Th seems to suggest that observation (and perhaps other actions taken) by the experimenter  different in some way to detection by the detector.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo if  understand the experiment correctly, two main conclusions from it are those  indicated in bold text above. My question  whether my understanding and these conclusions are correct.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t originally wanted to include a question about my interpretation of these results in terms of the difference between the experimenter and the detector, but th  getting too long, so \\'ll leave it at that.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t one first encounters quantum mechanics, he learns about Bohr\\'s model of the hydrogen atom and one of h biggest problems - electrons were accelerating and not emitting EM radiation (  sometimes referred to as \"radiation friction\"). Then when you solve Schrödinger\\'s equation with the following Hamiltonian:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou get stationary states of the electron, eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian, and no radiation friction  emitted. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tever, solving th Hamiltonian classically, also doesn\\'t give any evidence for radiation friction, because it doesn\\'t describe the interaction between the electron and the EM field. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo my question ,   th Hamiltonian taken to explain the lack of radiation friction in QM, whereas in classical electrodynamics it  an invalid Hamiltonian for that exact same reason Hope my question was clear, thank you!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ts there a pedagogical explanation of   a topological insulator for those that do not even know  the Berry phase  but have a basic understanding of quantum mechanics and solid state physics\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t read about  to solve the Schrödinger equation for the quantum harmonic oscillator in one dimension. t started with the Schrödinger equation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tt makes sense to me; that looks like energy conservation. Putting differential equations for the momentum operator,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThen they try to make remove the dimensions from the equation, so they replace  with a dimensionless  some, and divide the whole expression by . They then start a spree of confusing substitutions  mathematically are accurate, but appear to have no physical significance.  don\\'t understand  we do any of that. \\'s wrong with just staying with those differential equations and waiting for numbers  you can plug in and solve/integrate\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat source said that they\\'re trying to simplify th equation, because it\\'s very messy and difficult to solve, but if you only substitute and cancel terms, you are not adding any new information. So if we aren\\'t adding information to the equations, then \\'s the point of making these random-looking substitutions  don\\'t see any significance of expressing the energy with no dimensions.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe question in brief:  does it mean, operationally, to rotate an electron\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tElaboration/background:  am trying to understand  representation theory applies to quantum mechanics. A stumbling block for many learners, myself included,  spin. As it happens  already know the story about    not simply connected,  its double cover   simply connected, and  some representations of the latter fail to factor through . While  am no expert in representation theory,  know the basics, and can learn more myself as  need it.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRather, my problem  to understand exactly  experimental facts and procedures give us a representation. (n that sense, my question n\\'t really about electrons or even about quantum mechanics, since special relativity \"\" representation theory too, but my lack of understanding becomes especially acute in the case of spin.)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe expositions  have looked at usually say something like \"when you rotate an electron, the wavefunction transforms like a spinor\", but th  only helpful if  know \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t it means to rotate a particle; and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t to translate, at least in principle, from the physical situation to its mathematical description.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t have looked around at  here, but they are either quite advanced (QFT stuff) or focus on the mathematical machinery as opposed to  that machinery lines up with actual operations on lab equipment. For example, in another thread, Eric Zaslow writes:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  magine going to the rest frame of a massive particle. n th frame, there  rotational symmetry,  means that the Lie algebra of rotations acts on the wave function. So the wave function  a vector in a representation of Lie(SO(3)) = Lie(SU(2)). \"Spin\"  the label of precely  representation th . Note that while SO(3) and SU(2) share a Lie algebra, they are different as groups, and it  a fact of life (\"the connection between spin and stattics\") that some particles -- fermions, with half-integral spin -- transform under representations of SU(2) while others -- bosons, with integral spin -- transform under SO(3).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tZaslow\\'s answer\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTh  clearly stated but does not attempt to address my concern here,    operations in the lab translate to Lie group/algebra actions on the state space.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTo put my confusion in even starker terms: if  accept, and  do, that the state space of a particle   or rather the projectivization , then any Lie group  acts on  acts on the state space of the particle. So clearly the extence of an action  not the whole story. The remaining part of the story  the operational significance of the group... think. :)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo again, but in different words: when the theoretician acts on an electron wave function with a particular element of ,  does the experimentalt do \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to Ballentine, an irreducible tensor of degree k can be defined as a set of  operators  satfying the following commutation relations:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe usual examples employ scalars, vector operators and the irreducible subspaces of cartesian tensor operators.

By the set of states,  mean the convex set of density operators  on a Hilbert space  rather than the set of unit vectors in the Hilbert space . So  am talking about a convex subset of the vector space of Hermitian operators on  (for my puroposes, we can restrict to finite dimensions).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFor example, the set of states for a spin-1/2 particle  given by the Bloch ball.

Perhaps  should be clear about a few things:  do not think that quantum state spaces are dcrete, and  do not really try to justify dcreteness of quantum state spaces.  also see reasons  a quantum state space cannot be dcrete.  am just curious whether other physicts have come up with justifications or reasons for dcreteness.  To see  ideas are ruled out by arguments against dcreteness.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe answers so far are not uninteresting, but they provide reasons  a quantum state space should not be dcrete.  see that my question some asks for justification of something that cannot be, but  am still interested in  possible motivations for dcreteness there could be.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLet\\'s, for example, take a ribosome. t  an enzyme that  in turn just a molecule that must follow the laws of physics.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCorrect me if \\'m wrong, but it can be looked upon as a molecular machine made up of several pieces.  exactly makes those pieces work together\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t does the ribosome bind to a strand of RNA s it just the shape and electric charge or  it something more Once the ribosome  bound to a piece of RNA,  does it move\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tn a way, \\'m looking for the \"ghost in the machine\". \\'m interested in molecules in general, not just ribosomes.   it that, on a level of single atoms, makes molecules \"alive\" - move, assemble a protein, etc. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLet me give a hypothetical example:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmagine a strand of carbons.

Near the proton the electron\\'s kinetic energy will be relativtic and looking to the Schrödinger equation itself for  th boundary should behave seems dangerous because its kinetic energy term  only a non-relativtic approximation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ts there any physical intuition, or any math, that  can look to that should make me comfortable with the boundary condition in th region\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tConsider a lone photon. As its frequency increases, its energy increases. Taken to the limit, a sufficiently-high-frequency photon could be a black hole unto itself.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBut the frequency of a photon  dependent on the inertial frame of the observer. Two observers could each observe th photon to be either above or below th critical frequency. Or,  could accelerate to \"catch up\" to th photon, red-shifting it until it  no longer energetic enough to be a black hole.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo couldn\\'t  at one moment observe a particle to dappear beyond the event horizon, accelerate until the event horizon no longer exts, and hence observe  happened to the particle after crossing that threshold\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ts th in-principle possible f not,  not\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEDT: to clarify,  am not asking  much energy-due-to-photon-momentum  required to create a black hole,  am asking: given that threshold energy,  does the event horizon appear to different inertial frames  observe the photon to be above/below th threshold\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t understand that the double slit experiment (i.e. the creation of interference pattern) holds also when the \"particle\"  not just a single particle but any item, experimentally proven even for a C60 molecule.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t am wondering   the correct interpretation of the double slit experiment when the particle under test  a macroscopic object, like a space capsule with people inside.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t think that in order to obtain the interference pattern the capsule shouldn\\'t be hit by any photon coming from the external environment (or any other particle). So the people inside the capsule are not able to understand  slit they are going through since they can\\'t receive any information from the outside world.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPeople outside the capsule are not able either to see the capsule during h flight otherwe the wave function of the capsule will collapse to a specific position.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t guess the experiment setup would require extremely low temperature of the objects involved (at least on their external surface) and a very controlled environment.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ts th interpretation correct \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAre the people inside the capsule able to make some internal experiment to cause the capsule wave function to collapse (and to avoid any interference pattern when they hit the final wall) even without interacting with the external environment\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThanks\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Edit]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThanks for your answers. Actually  want to clarify my question.  am not asking  we don\\'t usually see interference pattern on macroscopic objects.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t am wondering \\'s the interpretation of the interference pattern we see (do we see it) when we setup an experiment with such macroscopic object. Obviously it  a thought experiment and it doesn\\'t really matter if it\\'s technically unfeasible.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tn example, considering the numbers that tom proposed, we have that _lambda  4e-38m. Now, if the slits are 10m wide and they are 1000m apart, the interference pattern should emerge for angles of about 4e-41 radiants.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo if the wall  like 1e45m far (let\\'s forget about cosmology) then we should see the crests of the interference pattern kilometers apart.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo  really happens in such scenario  can think of the following options:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1) nterference pattern emerge, passengers and external observer can\\'t tell  slit the ship went through since the experiment itself requires no interaction between the ship and the environment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2) nterference pattern doesn\\'t emerge even if the ship doesn\\'t interact with the other objects as it\\'s too complex and its wavefunction collapses anyway.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t3) \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe can make the experiment cosmologically more realtic. We can use a nanorobot (able to record some observations and perform little experiments, so conceptually equivalent to a human being) with a mass of 1e-18kg and make it travel at 1mm/s. f the slits are .1m apart, we should expect interference crests .1m apart after a Sun-Earth dtance.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tt  well accepted that quantum theory has well adapted itself to the requirements of special relativity. Quantum field theories are perfect examples of th peaceful coextence. ever  sometimes tend to feel little uneasy about some aspects. Consider an EPR pair of particles light years apart. Suppose there are 2 observers moving relative to each other with constant relative velocity. Let us consider, there are spin detection mechanm at both end for each particle. Now suppose one of the observer  at rest w.r.t. the detector for the first particle. As soon as the detection made, the wave function of the 2 particle entangled system will collapse instantaneously and the second particle must realize a definite opposite spin value. Now due to relativity of simultaneity, the second observer may claim that the collapse of the wave function for the two particle system  not simultaneous. He may even claim that the second particle  measured first. n that case a special frame of reference will be privileged, the frame at  the wave function collapsed instantaneously. Th will cause a significant strain on the core principle of special relativity.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t am sure the above reasoning  flawed.

Sometimes one happens to see non-rigorous demonstrations of Bloch\\'s Theorem without the use of periodic boundary conditions.

( was supposing there might be some concept of uncountable bas with then unique \"uncountable sums\" to represent each element...)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe only extended notion of bas there , as far as  see,  a Schauder bas  allows us to express any element as a countable linear combination of some countable collection that we call Schauder-bas, if and only if the space in question  separable.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWell,  guess some problem to it  that   not even a normed space, and therefore  can\\'t even ask whether there exts a Schauder-bas to it along the same line as  would do for a Hilbert space() Yet  think in the framework of rigged Hilbert spaces  comes with some induced topology and therefore one can at least address the question of whether  (or some  subspace if it)  topologically separable. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tndependent of  (or some  subspace if it) being separable, there  an uncountable  Hamel-bas to the eigenspaces  but then any state can be represented as linear combination of a finite subset of that Hamel-bas. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo not knowing whether the  are separable, a more well-defined question one might ask  whether there exts a Hamel-bas  of  such that each   eigenvector of all translations.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEdit 2:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tClearly, for the extence of a Schauder-bas completeness  a necessary condition.

The factor  neutralizes the above mentioned divergence.]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tndeed there appears to be a slight difference between the 3D and 1D case, when one observes the elementary case of a particle in a box. n both cases, outside of the box the wave function  exponentially decreasing. nside, where the particle  \"free\", the solution  oscillatory. n the 1D case, the wave function can be written as  n the 3D case, the wave function  given by the zeroth order Bessel function  [Apparently the term   omitted since it  considered unphysical, see previous paragraph.]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNow if the wave function inside the box has only one free parameter , all one can really do  determine its value by demanding continuity of the wave function on the boundary of the box.

First of all it creates a difference between the 3D and 1D case. Th seems odd to me since the corresponding wave functions satfy essentially the same Schroedinger equation.

Assume that in the lab A the experimenter orientates the polarizer in some direction, picked by him arbitrarily. Assume that in the lab B the experimenter orientates the polarizer by chance in the same direction. Then,  happens  that in the lab A the photon passes the polarizer, so does the photon in the lab B. But if in the lab A the photon doesn\\'t pass, neither does the photon in the lab B.

For those who don\\'t know, Bohmian mechanics  an interpretation of quantum mechanics that  in the class of  are known as \"hidden variable theories\",  are theories that posit the probabiltic and unreal wave functions of quantum mechanics are not the whole story of   going on but that there  hidden information behind that scenes and not accessible to our measuring devices  provides a determintic and well-defined physical state to the particle at each point in time, allowing us to speak of events proper, as opposed to just measurements with no idea of   going on in between or even saying it doesn\\'t ext at all or  meaningless despite our intuition not barfing at it in the way it would when presented with a truly meaningless phrase like \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\". t accomplhes th, at least in the context of simple fixed-particle non-relativtic QM with classical forces (\"semiclassical mechanics\"), by positing first a universal wavefunction, like in Everett\\'s many worlds theories, and then on top of that a hidden particle position for each particle in its universe that evolves according to a \"guiding equation\" that results in the particle positions having a Born rule dtribution at every point in time, and  effectively adds a \"tracer\" to the \"many worlds\"   taken as describing the actual world we see and  we don\\'t see the others. (Some people wonder about the fate of the other \"worlds\" in the wave function  then become so-called \"empty waves\", but  won\\'t get into that here. \\'m more interested in the pure structure of the theory itself, for the point of th inquiry.) t provides a rather neat account of the quantum measurement problem that both subsumes decoherence and addresses the uniqueness of outcomes: the measurement causes a local collapse through the same Everett-style decoherence process, and then the particles making up both the measured and measurer are shunted down a single branch of the universal wave function, thus explaining  we never see the rest. t has no invocation of nondeterminstic behavior at some kind of unspecifiable and ill-defined when-time (e.g. \"when a measurement\" ... but when  that  in the process does the nondetermintic collapse strike Or \"when in consciousness\" But when then  in the brain does th happen Etc.)  can plague some other interpretations. Or in terms  like, you can write a computer program to play a Universe game with the physics engine running Bohmian mechanics with no ambiguity at all as to where to place things like calls to the random number generator to collapse wavefunctions, something made not at all clear in the Copenhagen Non-nterpretation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe trick with th and the price to all its seeming very tantalizing advantages, ever, , of course, Bell\\'s theorem,  requires that any such theory be explicitly and truly nonlocal - that , in a relativtic context it demands communication of information - the hidden information, in particular - across a space-like separation, i.e. faster than light, into the \"elsewhere\" region of the space-time diagram. And indeed it makes not an exception to that, and does indeed involve such a communication of the hidden information. And th poses a serious problem for generalization of it to relativtic contexts like fully Relativtic Quantum Field Theories (RQFTs), including the celebrated jewel Quantum ElectroDynamics (QED),  make up the best theories of nature we have that are good to up to 12-15 decimal places in some cases, truly awesome marvels of scientific understanding and human endeavor indeed.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMy question, then,  th. t  often said that when it comes to th kind of thing, you have the following choice:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRelativity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFTL\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCausality\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand you must \"pick two, but not three\". Bohmian requires us to pick FTL, so we must then choose one of the other two, and the most common one  to pick causality, and sacrifice relativity, in particular, assert there must be some kind of universal or etheric reference frame, with the caveat th violates the Lorentz transformation symmetry that  considered so fundamental to the Universe.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tever,  \\'m wondering about :  if we choose instead to reject causality  if we bite the bullet and try to build a Lorentz-invariant Bohmian theory where that the hidden information does not have a preferred simultaneity, and can interact with its own past and future in an acausal manner Now some will say \"but then grandfather paradox\" - yet that\\'s not specific enough for me.  happens if we try to write down the math for such a thing and solve the equations  does it predict As \\'ve heard of the idea of \"self-constency principles\" (\"Novikov\\'s self constency principle\") and was wondering if that could work here. After all, the information  hidden, and it doesn\\'t let us predict anything other than regular QM would let us have access to as stated. f the four-dimensional evolution equations only permit self-constent solutions,  does that affect the theory  exactly does it fail,  might explain  it\\'s not done Like for example does the restriction of Novikov constency end up resulting in, say, no constent solutions exting, or does it cause something else, like a dramatic deviation from the Born rule stattics that would result in the theory\\'s predictions then coming to be at variance with regular QM and with observed reality\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOr if you have some philosophical quibble about causality, then forget about even the scientific applicability and think of it th way: just as a pure mathematical toy,  exactly happens when you try and construct a causality-violating relativtic Bohmian mechanics  would try it myself but wouldn\\'t be sure of  a simple space-time version of the guiding equation would be, and  think you\\'d also need to upgrade the Schrodinger equation to some relativtic form (e.g. Dirac or Klein-Gordon equation) for the trial run.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ts String Theory a Field or Quantum Mechanical Theory of the String rather than a Particle \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t should know th having studied th for a term, but we jumped into the deep end, without really covering the basics of the theory.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmagine that two widely separated charged particles  and  exchange a photon.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBecause they are far apart one can imagine that there  a major contribution to the photon propagator that travels at the speed of light from  at a time  to  at a time  where .\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBut in that case  there also a major contribution to the photon propagator that travels backwards in time at the speed of light from  at time  to  at time \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe forwards-in-time photon imparts momentum to particle  whereas the backwards-in-time photon imparts a reaction momentum back to particle .\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tt  well known that in the quantization of certain relativtic theories such electromagnetm or relativtic string negative norm states could are when quantizing covariantly.

As mentionned in Nielsen and Chuang, projective measurements are non-destructive, but there are measurement devices that destroy the state in the process of measuring it. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA maybe easier question, but one to  the answer would still satfy me would be:  kind of measurement operator (i.e. formalm 1, 2 or 3) are being realed by devices that measure qubit systems.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA lot of work has been done recently on electron dynamics using attosecond pump-probe techniques; for instance in th paper.  n th particular paper, the authors photoionized the neutral tetrapeptide  to the cation and observed the repopulation from the HOMO-1 to the HOMO (highest-occupied molecular orbital) of the cation in a time-resolved manner.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHere\\'s my question:  Since Heenberg\\'s uncertainty principle guarantees that the natural linewidth of a energy measurement will be greater than or equal to the inverse of the state\\'s lifetime times , i.e.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcould you just measure the natural linewidth of the photons emitted by the transition between the transient state and the final state and deduce the lifetime of the transient state  Or would the broadening be too large for subfemtosecond states to accurately determine the natural linewidth  Or, would other effects such as Doppler broadening be too large to get a reasonable measurement of the natural linewidth\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNote:  \\'m a long way out of my field of specialty (computational chemtry) in th question, so  apologize in advance if th makes no sense soever (please tell me , though, in your answer if th  the case).

So they try to determine the operator  responsible for th rotation ( acts on the spin-space and thus  represented by a 2x2 matrix). \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTo do th they first try to determine    the infinitesimal unitary operator for rotation about an infinitesimal angle  and they state that such an operator can always be written as:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t with  hermitic.

The main argument  the same in all the books available. nstead of following the very logical steps H1)-H4) presented above, one starts by constructing a vector depending on a parameter  and ss that th vector has limits when  becomes infinite.  must say that th type of reasoning  remincent of the way one treats scattering in the Schrodinger picture (SP). n the SP, one starts with an arbitrary state vector    time dependent according to the SP and then must s that  has asymptotes when (the real time)  becomes infinite.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t would be very grateful if you could help me with some answers to these :\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1)   the relation between the parameter  of H-R scattering and the real time, since when  becomes infinite they claim to have obtained the asymptotic scattering states\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2)   the physical interpretation of the vectors  in H-R scattering Are they obtained as a result of a measurement Are they in the Heenberg picture or in the Schrodinger picture\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t3) s there a CSCO such that the H-R asymptotic scattering states are the eigenvectors of th CSCO f yes,  th CSCO the asymptotic limit of a finite time Heenberg CSCO, as described in steps H1)-H4)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t4) Can one obtain asymptotic scattering states for an ARBTRARY CSCO using the H-R method Th should be the case since one can prepare the initial state as one wants at , and then can choose to measure  observable one wants at , and hence the CSCOs corresponding to preparation and measurement must be arbitrary.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEDT 2: @Pedro Ribeiro Your objections to Ekstein\\'s construction are perhaps unfounded:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t chose a dcrete spectrum for CSCOs in my presentation from EDT 1 only to convey the general idea with minimum notation. n case of a continuous spectrum one can use spectral projection operators as per von Neumann\\'s QM. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA Heenberg operator  acts in the full Hilbert space, i.e. in the same Hilbert space on  the total Hamiltonian  acts. The Haag theorem has to do with the fact that the free Hamiltonian  and the full Hamiltonian  act on 2 different Hilbert spaces. There  no connection between  and  or its associated Hilbert space for any time , finite or infinite. Hence, Haag\\'s theorem has no bearing on  and hence does not forbid the extence of th limit. Examples: f  commutes with , then   constant in time and the limit surely exts (see, e.g., the momentum operator). As a matter of fact, the whole LSZ idea  based on such limits! \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tt\\'s only one way a state can depend on time  in the Heenberg picture. That time  has to be a time at  some Heenberg operator, say ,  measured on the system, and as an effect the state becomes an eigenvector  of that operator. Otherwe, state vectors in the Heenberg picture do not evolve dynamically in time! One can look at my post. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFrom your presentation  still not very clear if the parameter   the time at  one chooses to measure a CSCO on the system and obtains an eigenvector() .

Starting on page 343 Haag dcusses h theory and in h own words says very clearly that the  states are manifestly in the Schrodinger picture, and   regular time. Only the asymptotic limits of  Haag considers to represent scattering states in the Heenberg picture. But even that cannot work since  has 2 limits, , and hence one needs 2 different Heenberg pictures, one that coincides with the Schrodinger picture at , and a 2nd one,  coincides with the Schrodinger picture at . So, he doesn\\'t stay all the time in the Heenberg picture, but uses most of the time the Schrodinger picture, and in the end, apparently, 2 different Heenberg pictures. ever, it\\'s well known that the Schrodinger picture does not ext in relativtic qft due to vacuum polarization effects!!!   left of Haag-Ruelle theory, then \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to press releases, researchers have reversed time in a quantum computer and violated the second law of thermodynamics.  does that mean for physics Will it allow time travel \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFurther information:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Arrow of time and its reversal on the BM quantum computer\" (Scientific Reports, 2019-03-13)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Physicts reverse time using quantum computer\" (Phys.org, 2019-03-13)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Einselection\" and \"tridecompositional uniqueness theorem\" seem to resolve the preferred bas problem.

Let\\'s turn our attention to the case with no detectors at the slits. f instead of a back screen, we replace that with a focusing lens with a screen further back such that the lens focuses the optical image of the slits sharply on the screen further back, then just by looking at  spot the photon ends up in, we can state with absolute certainty  slit the photon passed through. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAfshar introduced detector wires where the interference troughs should have been to detect any photon hitting those wires, but allowing photons to pass through unimpeded in between the narrow wires. The wires have some thickness, and so, a small fraction of the photon still hit them anyway, but the important point  th fraction  pretty low, and constent with an interference pattern.

But near the end of the second course, they also went into density operators/matrices.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThey were presented as another layer of abstraction on top of the more fundamental hilbert space, a convenient tool when dealing with classical stattic ensembles of pure states.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tever, reading the textbook and other sources, \\'ve seen it described as more fundamental than pure states, a natural description of subsystems of larger entangled systems, and having the very suggestive and appealing property that there  a one-to-one correspondence between states and operators, unlike in the hilbert space formalm where the correspondence  only up to a phase factor.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo,  there a description of quantum mechanics  takes density operators as the foundational objects, in the same way that the bra-ket formalm begins with rays of a complex space f so,  does it look like,  n\\'t QM taught in terms of density operators, and where can  find resources to study it Also,  have generally heard it  more awkward to work with than bras and kets,   it\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFinally, if we are representing states by operators, and treating pure states as special cases of density operators,  are they operations on Or  th just another case of representing abstract mathematical objects as operators for convenience, and there  no meaning to asking  they operate on\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t have been studying decoherence in quantum mechanics (not in qft, and don\\'t know  it  described there) and renormalization in QFT and stattical field theory,  found at first a similarity between the two procedures: on one side decoherence tells us to trace over the degrees of freedom we don\\'t monitor, in some way intrinsically unknown to recover a classical picture picture from quantum mechanics, on the other side by renormalizing we also integrate over \"our ignorance\" but th time, the U.V. physics or high energy modes to get the infra-red physics we observe. Beyond the technical similarity (taking a trace, for dcrete Kadanoff-Wilson transformations) it feels that in both cases we are forced to do these procedures because we start from a wrong picture where we separate the free object (purely quantum in the first case, with bare parameters in the second one) and then calculate the effects of the interactions, that are responsible from  we, observers, see, classical and infra-red physics. Th where it comes to me that some interested links between the two concepts may ext or be pointed out (and also wonder  decoherence becomes in QFT).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t still see one huge asymmetry between the two, decoherence  dynamical, it has a typical time of decay, where renormalization  static.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t hope  could explain my interrogation clearly, and some interesting comments will come.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tn comments to a Phys.SE question, it has been written: \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  \\'Tunneling\\'  perfectly real, even in classical physics.

For quantum-mechanical reversibility doesn\\'t merely say that information must eventually be retrievable, after 1070 years or ever; but also that, if U  an admsible transformation of a physical system, then U-1  also an admsible transformation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo, just like it must be constent with reversible microlaws for smoke and ash to spontaneously reassemble into a book, it must also be constent for a black hole to spontaneously \"uncollapse\" into a star, or into ever configuration of ordinary matter could have collapsed to form the black hole in the first place.  And th \"white-hole uncollapse process\" must be possible in exactly the same amount of time as the black-hole collapse process, rather than an astronomically longer time (as with Hawking radiation).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tn both cases, the explanation for  we never see these processes must be thermodynamic -- i.e., sure they\\'re allowed, but they involve such a crazy decrease in entropy that they\\'re exponentially suppressed.   get that.

(Granted, QFT also predicts that the radiation should be thermal!  But because of AdS/CFT and so forth, today people seem pretty confident that the information, after hanging out near the event horizon,  carried away by the Hawking radiation in some not-yet-understood way.)  ever, suppose it\\'s objected that a Hawking radiation process seems nothing soever like the time-reverse of an ordinary black-hole formation process.  Then the only response  know would be along the lines of, \"well, do you believe that QM will survive unaltered in a future quantum theory of gravity, or don\\'t you  f you do, then consider the unitary U corresponding to a black-hole formation process, and invert it to get U-1!\"  My question :  couldn\\'t people have made that same straightforward argument even before they knew anything about Hawking radiation  (Or did they make it)  More generally, even if Hawking radiation does carry away the infalling information, that still seems extremely far from implying full quantum-mechanical reversibility.

And yet   not a function of the angle , even though there  no operator in quantum mechanics corresponding to .  (There  another operator called ,   one of the position operators in spherical coordinates, but that has nothing to do with spin and the  that \\'m talking about.)

Under certain circumstances, the probabiltic reduction plus the measurement process could conceivably approximately mimic quantum mechanics,  don\\'t see a proof otherwe. But the devil  in the details.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tn \\'t Hooft models, you also have two processes:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTime evolution: .\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMeasurement reduction: the measurement of an observable corresponding to some subsystem at intermediate times, , as in standard quantum mechanics, reduces the wavefunction by a projection.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first process, time evolution,  guaranteed to keep you not superposed in the global variables, since th  just a permutation in \\'t Hooft\\'s formulation, that\\'s the whole point. But  have seen no convincing argument that the second process, learning a bit of information through quantum measurement, corresponds to learning something about the classical state and reducing the CA probabiltic state according to Bayes\\' rule.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSince \\'t Hooft\\'s models are completely prece and calculable (th  the great virtue of h formulation), th can be asked precely:  the reduction of the wavefunction in response to learning a bit of information about the CA state through an internal observation always mathematically equivalent to a Bayes reduction of the global wavefunction\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t will point out that if the answer  no, the \\'t Hooft models are not doing classical automata, they are doing quantum mechanics in a different bas. f the answer  yes, then the \\'t Hooft models could be completely rewritable as proper activities on the probability dtribution , rather than on quantum superposition states.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ts it logically sound to accept the canonical commutation relation (CCR)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tas a postulate of quantum mechanics Or  it more correct to derive it given some form for  in the position bas \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t understand QM formalm works, it\\'s just that  sometimes end up thinking in circles when  try to see where the postulates are. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCould someone give me a clear and logical account of  should be taken as a postulate in th regard, and an explanation as to  their viewpoint  the most right, in some sense!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Poson bracket  defined as:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe anticommutator  defined as:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe commutator  defined as:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t are the connections between all of them\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEdit: Does the Poson bracket define some uncertainty principle as well\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRule  learned:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  only photons with quanta of energy match matching the exact difference between energy levels can be absorbed/ reemitted.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBut to me optical density works opposite to th rule.

Presenting the unravelled trajectories in  Stratonivich form allows the open quantum dynamics of general Lindblad processes to be pulled-back with the same geometric naturality as closed quantum dynamics of Hamiltonian potentials and symplectic forms.  Th Lindbladian pullback idiom  absent from mathematical dcussions of geometric quantization, e.g. the above-mentioned article Bloch et al..  n essence we engineers are using these pullback techniques with good success, without having a complete or even geometrically natural understanding of them.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPulling back through successive state-spaces of smaller-and-smaller dimensionality, we arrive (unsurpringly) at an innermost state-space that  a tensor product of Bloch spheres that inherits its (classical) symplectic structure from the starting Hilbert space.  Moreover, the Lindblad processes pull back (also unsurpringly) to classical noe and backaction that respects the standard quantum limit.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFor multiple systems engineering reasons, we would like to understanding th stratification backwards and forwards, in the following geometrically literal sense: on any state-space of th stratification, we wh the dual option of either pulling-back the dynamics onto a more classical state-space, or pushing-forward the dynamics onto a more quantum state-space.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnsofar as possible, the hoped-for description of geometric (de/re)quantization will illuminate th duality in both directions.   Needless to say, the simpler and more geometrically/informatically natural the description of th duality, the better (recognizing that th naturality  a lot to hope for). :)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAs a preface,  am not a physict.  \\'m simply interested in abstract physics and fundamental principles of the universe and such.  As such, if you can provide an answer for the layman (as non-academic and unjargonized as possible), it would be very, very appreciated so that  can actually understand it.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEverything  ever learned about physics seemed to be built off of an assumption that the universe and everything in it behaved determintically.  So it should always be a (theoretical) possibility that, given perfect knowledge of every particle and force in the universe at a given moment, we can calculate with 100% accuracy  the state of the universe will be in the next moment.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTh of course assumes omncience and unlimited computational capacity,     said th  only a theoretical possibility.  ever, we can define our closed system to be much smaller -- say, a bottle full of nitrogen and helium -- and apply th principle more directly.  And it seems like th assumption  absolutely necessary for scientific experiments to even take place or have any validity, since without th kind of determinm, the observations and the results inferred from them can\\'t ever actually be trusted.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t don\\'t understand quantum mechanics very well, but it seems like th theory breaks th assumption completely.  From   understand, there  no way to predict  the state of the particle will be at the next moment.  The most  can know  that, given that a particle  in state A, it will next be in state B or state C.  There  absolutely no way to know for sure, and the only way to find out  to observe it actually change.  Furthermore, observations of th kind don\\'t yield any insight into  other particles in state A will do.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo, in classical physics, laws used to look like th:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA -&gt; B   [A implies B]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBut with quantum physics, all of th  gone, and our laws can at best look something like th:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA -&gt; ((B v C) v D) v E   [A implies B, or C, or D, or E, or ...]  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t does th not break everything physics  built upon  The implications of th are seriously troubling to me, and  feel like it destroys everything  thought  knew.  Can anyone explain  th works in slightly lower-level terms, or s  it\\'s still possible for the theories and laws of classical physics to hold any weight\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tn quantum mechanics, one makes the dtinction between mixed states and pure states.  A classic example of a mixed state  a beam of photons in  50% have spin in the positive -direction and 50% have spin in the positive -direction.  Note that th  not the same as a beam of photons, 100% of  are in the state\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tt seems, ever, that at least in principle, we could describe th beam of particles as a single pure state in a \\'very large\\' Hilbert space, namely the Hilbert space that  the tensor product of all the  particles ( think that\\'s the proper order of magnitude at least).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo then,  the density operator a mathematical convenience, or are there other aspects of quantum mechanics that truly require the density operator to be a \\'fundamental\\' object of the theory\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(f   mean by th  at all unclear, please let me know in the comments, and  will do my best to clarify.)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\'ve always seen the standard interpretation and axioms of QM as in some way tricky on a philosophical level.

Also, a symmmetry transofrmation   takes rays  into  has an inverse written   takes  into  and there  an identity transformation   leaves rays unchanged.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHe also states Wigner\\'s theorem that states that symmetry transformations defined as above can be realized either by unitary linear or antiunitary and antiliear operators on the Hilbert space . n h notation, for every symmetry transformation  one gets a unitary operator . Then Weinberg proves that\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying that   a projective representation of the symmetry transformations.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter th recap, here are my :\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo by (1) above, to deal with symmetryes, Weinberg  actualy implictly considering that there  a group  such that we have one homomorphm  mapping  into the group of ray transformations\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tn other words, for every  we have  a ray transformation. Upon imposing the symmetry requirement by (2) above, we have that all  descends to one  and these  form a projective representation of  . \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBecause of that in the end he forgets  altogether and directly works with projective representations of  on the Hilbert space of states. s that it\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe main difference between  \\'m writing and Weinberg  that \\'m trying to abstract a group from its representations. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo \\'m guessing there  one underlying group  of symmetries,  give re to the ray transformations and then to the projective representations, while Weinberg seems to identify  with the ray transformations themselves.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ts my point of view correct of considering there  one abstract group behind all of th Or there  actually no group behind the ray transformations, and Weinberg  actually defining a group with the ray transformations themselves, instead\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tClassically it was said that measurement leads to a collapse of the wave function. ever, if there wouldn\\'t be any limit on the process on measurement itself, strange things can happen, e.g. a particle that  confined to a small region by a very strong potential could by measuring its momentum with high precion be made to be spread out instantaneously all over space. Likewe, if a particle  detected at one location, so its position  measured with very high precion, at any moment after that it can be detected arbitrarily far away.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tn Feynman\\'s lectures on physics, he goes into the explicit measurement process in the double slit experiment, where light  used to detect  slit the electron passed through. As long as the photons can detect the slit the electron went through, the interference pattern  destroyed.  the frequency of the light  reduced to diminh the impact, the interference pattern keeps being dturbed, up to the moment when the wavelength of the photons  so large that they are not able to determine  slit the electron passed through.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLikewe, in th answer by John Rennie to the question  it can be that if you measure the momentum of a particle with very high precion its uncertainty may extend over one light year, he explains  (doing th with light at least) a measurement with that precion would take a year. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAs another example, in th answer by DanielSank to the part of my question where it was asked  it could be that a measurement of a particle in a box with infinite walls could be made to tunnel out by making a measurement, it was suggested that there  a fundamental limitation on the precion of the measurement.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tn all three examples it looks like the restrictions on the measurement process are exactly conspiring to avoid any undesired behaviour to occur. s there any fundamental reason for that\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThanks!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t am having problem in understanding  do we consider the continuity of the Logarithmic derivative of the wave function at the boundary of the Scattering Potential   understand that physical arguments require the wavefunction to be continuous but  the logarithmic derivative.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t where a  the length scale of the scattering potential.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTh might be a very elementary question.

So it appears to be a serious endeavor, but it\\'s approach to many things  non-standard and often just sounds wrong to me. n dcussing h approach to some topics the author says:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  On action as an observable\\n  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  Numerous physicts finh their university studies without knowing that action  a physical observable. Students need to learn th. Action  the integral of the Lagrangian over time. t  a physical observable: action measures  much  happening in a system over a lapse of time. f you falsely believe that action  not an observable, explore the sue and convince yourself - especially if you give lectures.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thttp://www.motionmountain.net/onteaching.html\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFurther on the author also dcusses measurements of th physical observable, saying\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  No single experiment yields [...] action values smaller than hbar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo  think he does mean it literally that action  physically measurable and  furthermore quantized. But in  sense, if any, can we dcuss action as an observable\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMy current thoughts:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNot useful in answering the question in general, but hopefully explains where my confusion  coming from.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t will admit, as chasted in the quote,  did not learn th in university and actually it just sounds wrong to me. The textbook covers classical and quantum mechanics, and  really don\\'t see  th idea fits in either.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tClassical physics\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe system evolves in a clear path, so  guess we could try to measure all the terms in the Lagrangian and integrate them along the path. ever, multiple Lagrangians can describe the same evolution classically. The trivial example being scaling by a constant. Or consider the Lagrangian from electrodynamics  includes a term proportional to the vector potential,   itself not directly measurable. So if Action was actually a \"physical observable\", one could determine the \"correct\" Lagrangian,  to me sounds like nonsense.  Maybe \\'m reading into the phrasing too much, but  cannot figure out  to interpret it in a manner that  actually both useful and correct.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tQuantum mechanics\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAt least here, the constant scaling sue from classical physics goes away. ever the way to use the Lagrangian in quantum mechanics  to sum over all the paths. Furthermore, the sue of the vector-potential remains. So  don\\'t see  one could claim there  a definite action, let alone a measurable one.  Alternatively we could approach th by asking if the Action can be viewed as a self-adjoint operator on Hilbert space ... but the Action  a functional of a specific path, it  not an operator that acts on a state in Hilbert space and gives you a new state. So at first blush it doesn\\'t even appear to be in the same class of mathematical objects as observables.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tUltimately the comments that experiments have measured action and s it  quantized, make it sound like th  just routine and basic stuff  should have already learned. n  sense, if any, can we dcuss action as a physical observable  would experiments measuring it even look like\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAre there any \"natural\" physical observables  have non-empty point spectrum  consts of numbers  are not algebraic numbers\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTrying to wrap my head around the following situation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tConsider first a case that  understand well: Let\\'s assume a three level system where the lowest two levels are degenerate and individually couple to a third level, higher in energy by some large .

But quantum systems don\\'t admit the same canonical transformation structure as classical systems, so there might be systems  have an integrable classical limit, but no real sign of integrability outside of the classical limit.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBut  don\\'t know any examples! Most of the 1+1d integrable stuff  for cases where the classical and quantum integrability are linked up, for the obvious reason that people are interested in finding integrable systems, not examples where they are not. The reason  think finding an example  not trivial  because the classical integrability guarantees that the motion  not classically chaotic, and that the asymptotic quantum energy states are pretty regular. So  don\\'t think one can look for a counterexample in finite dimensions, where all high enough energy states are permanently semi-classical.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBut consider a field theory on a lattice in 2+1 dimensions (continuous time). The lattice  so that the dynamics can be arbitrary, no continuum limit, no renormalization. Even if you have an integrable classical dynamics for the field theory, the energy can still dsipate over larger volumes (th n\\'t 1+1 d), and eventually the classical field will be weak enough that the classical limit  no longer valid, and you see the quanta. Th allows the possibility that every finite energy state to eventually leave the semi-classical domain, and turns quantum, and then the integrability  lost.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo  there a 2+1 (or 3+1) dimensional lattice scalar field theory where the classical dynamics  integrable, but the quantum mechanical system  not\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBy saying that the quantum system  not integrable,  mean:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe many particle S-matrix doesn\\'t factorize or simplify in any significant way (aside from the weak asymptotic relations implied by having a classical integrable limit)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthere are only a finite number of quantum conserved currents (but an infinite number of conserved currents in the classical limit).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo far in our lecture we defined creation operators  in the following way, that we said: \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSomebody got you a antymmetric or symmetric N- particle state and now  puts another particle in state n, so that we end up with a symmetric/antymmetric N+1-particle state.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTh interpretation  some clear to me in the sense that these  operators avoid the cumbersome slater determinants and so on.

Mathematically rigorous sources usually treat these systems by manually limiting the domain of definition of the wave functions and examining boundary conditions  make certain observables ess. self adjoint. My take on th  that these systems should in some sense be seen as \"limits\" of quantum systems with finite potentials. \\'m not familiar with mathematically rigorous treatments of potentials,  have apparently fourhed since the 50s; \\'ve been told by many physicts that their results aren\\'t really interesting from a physical point of view.
